# Spaceship Tutorials

We provide 4 tutorials, each of which is intended to teach the following usages of spacecraft.

- [building](./building/): Building the spacecraft core as well as its Python bindings.
- [forking](./forking/): Using spacecraft's Python bindings to simulate the execution of cosmwasm smart contracts.
- [cheat-codes](./cheat-codes/): Using spacecraft's cheat codes, which are special builtin functions capable of manipulating blockchain parameters.
- [coverage](./coverage/): Using spaceship's code coverage extension to obtain a [grcov](https://github.com/mozilla/grcov) style coverage report of cosmwasm smart contracts.
